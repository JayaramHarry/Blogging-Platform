Assignment Title: "Simple Blogging Platform"

Objective:
To build a basic blogging platform where users can create, view, edit, and delete
blog posts.

Frontend (ReactJS):
- Homepage: Display all blog posts in a list with titles and snippets.
- Post Detail Page: Clicking on a blog post opens the full article.
- Create/Edit Post: Forms to create new posts or edit existing ones, using controlled
components for form handling.
- Navigation: A simple navigation bar to switch between the homepage and post
creation.

Backend (Node.js):
- Server Setup: A simple Express server.
- REST API Endpoints: Create endpoints for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE).
- Database: Use a simple file system or a NoSQL database like MongoDB for storing
posts.
- Authentication: Optional - simple token-based authentication to manage posts.

General Requirements:
- Code Quality: Clear naming conventions, directory structure, and commenting.
- Error Handling: Basic error handling on both client and server sides.
- Design: A clean, responsive design, possibly using a UI framework like Bootstrap
or Material-UI.

Submission:
Candidates should submit their code via a GitHub repository, with a README.md
file explaining how to set up and run the application.
Hosting and giving the live URL link is a plus.

Assessment Criteria:
- Code organization and clarity.
- Functionality of the CRUD operations.
- Understanding of ReactJS and Node.js basics.
- Error handling and edge cases consideration.
- Cleanliness and responsiveness of the UI.
This assignment balances the need to see a candidate's coding style and
understanding of the full stack without being overly complex. It also offers
candidates the chance to showcase additional skills, like adding authentication or a
more complex database, if they're more experienced.
